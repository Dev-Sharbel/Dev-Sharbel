# I am -- Sharbel Chaak --

### Who are you?
> A computer science undergraduate(Expected 2024) with varying experience in **_C_**, vanilla **_Frontend\*_**, **_PHP_**, **_Java_**, **_Golang_**, **_ASP.NET\*_**, **_Godot Engine_**, **_Android Studio\*_**, **_Flutter\*_**, **_Unity Engine_**, and the ability to pick up new skills at great speeds!
### But is that enough?
> Not for me. _Balance is my key to life_, and I have _yet_ to reach it.  
> ---Currently working hard to gain further experience in **_Backend_** **and** **_Frontend_**.
> ---Exploring multiple paths before picking one to specialize in.
### And what about you?
> I am a person who values honesty and good above all else. (Perhaps too good for my own benefit sometimes, but that is my code)
> ---With a passion for programming since youth and aspirations to further my knowledge in the field, my ultimate dream & goal is... to create a beautiful family! (Expectedly or otherwise, it is my honest dream.)
> ---My hobbies are mostly centered around reading, writing, and learning new things. I aspire to go out of my comfort zone and try new things (or pick up old ones) such as hiking or fishing.
> ---To explore a thousand worlds. To delve into a thousand minds. My love for reading and writing is both a hobby and a companion.

### Is that all?
> This is all that is worth mentioning for now. I have a lot going on for me(Like all people do!), so I'll update accordingly!

# I am -- Sharbel Chaak --

### Who are you?
> A computer-science undergraduate(Expected 2024) with experience in **_Frontend_**, **_PHP_**, **_Java_** and, **_C_**.
### But is that enough?
> Not for me. _Balance is my key to life_, and I have _yet_ to reach it.  
> ---Currently working hard to gain further experience in **_Frontend_** **and** **_backend_**.
### And what about you?
> I am a person who values honesty and respect above all else.  
> ---With a passion for programming since youth and ambitions to grow further, my ultimate dream & goal is to create a beautiful family! _Beauty in Simplicity!_  
> ---My hobbies are mostly centered around reading new things. From novels to science documentaries. I'm aspiring to go out of my comfort zone and try new things (or pick up old ones) such as hiking and/ or fishing.

### Is that all?
> That is all worth mentioning for now. I have a lot more going on for me(Like all people do!) and so I'll make sure to update accordingly!
